<h3 id="são-josé-da-ponta-grossa-fortress-and-praia-do-forte">São José da Ponta Grossa Fortress and Praia do Forte</h3>
<p>The fortress is really a beautiful place, which is worth knowing. It is a Portuguese fort built in 1765 which features include cannons, costumes and utensils used at the time.</p>
<p>Admission is only 8 reais (students pays 4 reais and seniors are exempt). Access to the fortress however is a little complicate if you go by car. The path is a very steep climb and the road splits into two trails where two cars pass very carefully. Therefore, if you go by car it is recommended that you leave the car down (near the last Jurerê bus stop) and walk up. If you drive up, you can go down to Praia do Forte also by car. Be careful! Sand on the track can complicate your way up, okay?</p>
<p>Anyway, once on the top, go around the fort, see the sun or the sunset over Praia do Forte and enjoy the historical tour and the breathtaking view you have from up there. Praia do Forte has a few restaurants &quot;feet in the sand&quot;, so it is also good for happy hour.</p>
